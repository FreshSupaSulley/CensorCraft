# common

Processes the audio buffer and other general, non-forge specific things. This is considered just another source folder
to the mod-loader subprojects.

Honestly I'm only keeping this "common" folder here in case we need to one day support different mod loaders, but I'm
sort of just embracing forge at the moment.
